Hi, my names Gabriel and I am a developer and designer based in London. I work with javascript, node, react html and css. In my spare time I like to build things that help other people to express themselves creatively. If you want to see what I have been working on lately then have a look at some of my projects.

Recently I was lucky enough to be a participant at the recurse center where I joined their fall 1 batch. I got to meet some interesting people and collaborate on some cool projects! Now that I am finished I am continuing to teach myself javascript whilst I look for work. If you think that we might work well together then please get in contact!
