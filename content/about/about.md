Hi, my name is Gabriel and I am a developer and designer based out of London. I work with javascript, node, react, html and css. In my spare time I like to build things that help other people express themselves creatively. Lately I have been working on browser based musical instruments. You can see a collection of my recent projects [here](http://gabrieldavison.com/projects).

This year I was lucky enough to be a participant at the [recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I joined their Fall 1 batch. It was great to have the opportunity to join such a creative educational environment. Since finishing my batch I am continuing to work on personal projects while taking on freelance work.

If you think that we could work well together then please get in contact!
