A command based musical sequencer that can be played using a computer keyboard. It uses an instance of [Engine](https://github.com/gabrieldavison/engine) to generate sound. It's inspired by the [spacetime study](https://monome.org/docs/norns/study-3/) for [monome norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/).
